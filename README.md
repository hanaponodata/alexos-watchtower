Watchtower

Enterprise-grade agentic, sovereign, extensible OS and protocol.
Overview

Watchtower is a modular, production-grade, fully future-proofed platform for:

    Real-time monitoring, logging, and registry of agents, events, and system state.

    Self-healing, federation, and symbolic/entropy protocol extension.

    Automated recursive upgrades, lineage, and evolutionary protocol branching.

    On-chain, cryptographic, and quantum-proof security.

    Full plugin/extension marketplace, LLM/AI proxy, and artifact registry.

Key Features

    Sovereign, federated, multi-node mesh support

    Distributed ledger and tamper-proof audit trails

    Enterprise security: RBAC, on-chain/NFT/Sigil auth, ZKP, hardware/quantum entropy

    Live dashboards, WebSocket event streams, and agent registry

    Modular: All core domains are extensible and plugin-ready

    CI/CD, DevOps, and GitOps ready from day one

    Compliance, SIEM, webhook, and reporting integration

    LLM/AI copilot orchestration with agent scoring and shadow audit

    Backup, restore, migration, failover, and self-healing logic built-in

# Watchtower - ALEX OS Integration

## Deployment
- Use the provided `systemd` unit (`watchtower.service`) for lifecycle management.
- All configuration is via `.env` (see `.env.template`).
- PostgreSQL is managed via Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`).

## Configuration & Secrets
- All secrets/config are injected via `.env` (never hardcoded).
- Use ALEX OS secret management for production.

## API & WebSocket
- All endpoints are OpenAPI/Swagger documented.
- Register `/api/agents`, `/api/events`, `/api/status`, `/dashboard/api/*` in the ALEX OS API gateway.
- WebSocket endpoint: `/dashboard/ws` (for real-time updates).

## Authentication & RBAC
- Integrate with ALEX OS Auth (JWT/API key) for all endpoints.
- No standalone login in production.

## Logging & Audit
- All logs to `logs/app.log`.
- Audit/compliance data available via API and exportable.

## Testing
- Automated tests in `tests/`.
- E2E: launch Watchtower, create agent, stream events, validate audit log.

## Upgrade
- Alembic DB migrations must run on every deploy/upgrade.

## Health Monitoring
- `/api/status` returns health, version, uptime, active agents, error count.

## Security
- No secrets in repo. All endpoints RBAC-checked. Logs never expose sensitive info.
